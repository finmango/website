Seeing mere statistics: that FinMango is just 5 years old, or that we have so many young people actively involved from across the world \u2014 you might cultivate the false belief that building something impactful is easy.</p><p id=\"\">Behind the scenes, we have fallen short countless times for countless reasons. But in a way, that\u2019s the beauty of it\u2026 Entrepreneurship is the art of making the most out of available and often, limited resources.

He is currently in 6th grade and is passionate about Math, English and Science. He believes he grew up extremely driven and focused and wants to get to a high place in life. To Pranav, getting to a high place means \u201c...getting a really good rank in whatever he does.\u201d Whether that be getting his PhD, becoming an astronaut who goes to Mars, or becoming a \u2018top\u2019 doctor. Pranav\u2019s goal is to simply be the best and most successful version of himself he can be. When he isn\u2019t doing school work or focused on being a financial wiz, Pranav enjoys reading, drawing comics, crafting and so much more. A few fun facts about Pranav include, his love for learning about how antibiotics work against different viruses and germs etc. and his fascination with moving from one planet to another. Pranav\u2019s mind is always thinking big and focused on the impossible for many, that will one day become possible to him. </p><p id=\"\">Pranav\u2019s interest in financial literacy and investment began when he overheard his parents talking about stocks and investing. He never understood what those words signified and when he realized it had to do with money he wanted to get involved and learn about stocks and investing, to see what he could do with his money. He spoke to his parents about it and ended up taking some financial education classes with another amazing FinMango advocate; Carolyn Cooper.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:750px\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"750px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"IMG_2573.JPG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ed741aa354510028ba7_624b0c7bcc8aaaca36020392_IMG_2573.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Not only did Pranav develop his financial education, but he took it a step further and is currently running his own business; <a href=\"https://bunnysitting101.business.site/\" id=\"\">Bun Bun Bunny Sitting</a>. Pranav has a pet bunny of his own and the thought crossed his mind as to what would be done with his rabbit if he was on a trip. It then escalated into thinking, \u201cWhat do people in general do with their pets when they need to take a trip or vacation?\u201d This thought snowballed even further and led to Pranav setting up a website using google my business and creating his own business where individuals can request his services, to have their rabbits cared for while they are away. </p><p id=\"\">As Pranav\u2019s business was taking off and he was increasing his financial education with Carolyn\u2019s help, he found about FinMango through her and ended up taking one of Mango Bob\u2019s investment classes. Pranav believes that \u201cMango Bob\u2019s class was extremely good. He went into detail about everything, he made it easy to understand and you could tell what he was doing from his teaching.\u201d Pranav believes others should take this class (especially the younger generations) because of the impact it can have. Without being educated on these topics, it could harm one\u2019s financial future and younger generations are in a lucky spot and should take advantage of their age and start learning how to prepare themselves for the future.</p><p id=\"\">Asides from being involved in FinMango\u2019s classes, Pranav also had the opportunity to appear on a <a href=\"https://www.ngpf.org/blog/podcasts/ngpf-podcast-carolyn-cooper-and-her-student-pranav-discuss-the-importance-of-financial-education/\" id=\"\">podcast</a> with Tim Ranzetta at Next Gen Personal Finance, which focused on stocks and bonds; what they are and how they work.</p><p id=\"\">Pranav is immensely passionate about financial literacy and when asked what he wishes to see being done differently in schools to address financial literacy, his response was to have more exposure. He believes the biggest issue is that people simply do not know what investing is, how to do it or its importance and that needs to change. People tend to have their money sitting in a bank where no growth is being seen, when they could be investing and growing it.</p><p id=\"\">Three pieces of advice he wants to leave are:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Relating to stocks : Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification over different stocks is important. </li><li id=\"\">Start investing when you are young, as your money will grow over time. </li><li id=\"\">Don\u2019t end up in debt as this will compound over time. </li></ul><p id=\"\">In the end helping people around the world is what makes Pranav happy. He strives to find ways to give and support others. Whether that be through his bunny sitting business, appearing on podcasts, advocating for development in financial literacy (especially in schools) or becoming a top doctor one day.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2500px\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2500px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"IMG_3392.JPG\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ed741aa354cb3028ba8_624b0c7caa918d0a8223a1fb_IMG_3392.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><br></p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p>", "is_field": true}, {"title": "Some Lessons From Grandma", "date": "Jan 15, 2021", "year": 2021, "location": "India", "excerpt": "By Ahana SamatGrowing up, my weekends and holidays were all spent the same way.", "image": "https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ee1fcb9dc3a44f8d874_624b0a92c2347b04ecb5015a_Untitled%2520design%2520(51).jpeg", "body": "<p id=\"\">By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamatAhana\" id=\"\">Ahana Samat</a></p><p id=\"\">Growing up, my weekends and holidays were all spent the same way. My parents, both of whom worked full time, even on Saturdays, would drop me off in the morning at my grandmother\u2019s apartment and pick me up in the evening. This routine became such a way of life for me, that it continued on unquestioned even as a teenager. </p><p id=\"\">Every morning, I would be greeted the same way. \u201cHi <em id=\"\">Putta,</em>\u201d she would say, evoking my nickname, her characteristic bindi in the middle of her forehead, and her sari so neatly pinned up, that I often joked that it looked like it had been pleated with a ruler.</p><p id=\"\">In the extensive time I have spent with my grandmother, or <em id=\"\">Bajju</em>, as everyone calls her, my appreciation for her fierce independence has only grown.</p><p id=\"\">In a small town in India in the 1970s, Bajju, a single mother, worked two jobs as a teacher and a tutor, for what must have been 10 hours a day, to single-handedly sustain her family. She independently financially supported my mother through school, university, and graduate school. All this at a time when most women were afforded little autonomy, and those who seized opportunities and broke glass ceilings were discriminated against systematically.</p><p id=\"\">Very little of my general perspective on life has remained untouched by Bajju. Through leading by example, she has taught me some of the most profound lessons in life, the most important of which helps me manage my finances as a college student.</p><p id=\"\">For starters, she showed me the importance of recording everything I spend. And I mean, EVERYTHING. For as long as I can remember, every time we came back from buying groceries, she would immediately write down the amount she spent in a little notebook. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of it, but as I began living on my own, I emulated that habit. While I use an excel sheet to record all my expenses instead of pen and paper, the importance of organization and discipline in having adequate information to make informed fiscal decisions is not lost on me. Sometimes, I am scared to know how much I spend for fear that I have made bad monetary decisions. However, knowing exactly where my money goes helps me cut down on subscriptions, takeout, or Amazon packages when I need to.</p><p id=\"\">But it\u2019s not just about not wasting money, it\u2019s also about not wasting things. A rule that Bajju enforced- and that I continue to hold onto- was to never waste food. I never throw away the food I cook, I never take more on my plate than I know I can eat, and I always store leftovers in the freezer for subsequent meals. &nbsp;Most of my friends and I often say we would save so much money if we stopped eating out. An<a href=\"https://www.moneyunder30.com/the-true-cost-of-eating-in-restaurants-and-how-to-save\" id=\"\"> article</a> by Money Under 30 on the true cost of eating out quantifies this opinion, - actually fact. So, every time I think of ordering in, I also think about whether there is food in my fridge and if I want to waste it. It sounds silly but it\u2019s saved me so much money!</p><p id=\"\">Why stop at food? Bajju would always recycle glass containers (like those that hold pasta sauce, for example) to hold grains, lentils, or leftovers instead of throwing them away. I recycle all my pasta sauce jars to hold food, stationary, and even act as vases. On a more philosophical level, I have begun to appreciate the variety in utility of every material and how one\u2019s creativity can add to it.</p><p id=\"\">The core of any endeavor, Bajju has taught me, is the drive to learn. Every afternoon when I visited, Bajju and I would sit beside each other: She would be reading (she is never without a book), and &nbsp;I would be working on homework. Whenever she comes across a word she does not know, she immediately consults the dictionary to learn what it means. If she is not satisfied with the explanation, she consults the thesaurus. </p><p id=\"\">I apply her example to personal finance. I choose a topic, research it online, and reference several sources before I am satisfied. Sometimes, it is investopedia; sometimes, it is an eBook from my university library: and sometimes, it is my favorite personal finance Instagram account, but I try to make sure I <em id=\"\">really </em>understand it. The process is never complete - it is comprehensive and exhaustive. But, it is an invaluable lesson in the determination to master a topic and the ambition to succeed.</p><p id=\"\">Admittedly, I may be biased. But, of all the books I have read, podcasts I have listened to, and the research I have done, I have yet to come across a better financial role model than Bajju.

Over the last two years, we have helped establish new protocols, and enhance the efficiency of the existing ones across 27 districts. This has helped ensure that over 20 million new beneficiaries have access to basic bank accounts. Our project has been deemed successful and has allowed the Government of India to expand it across all 112 backward 'aspirational' districts in the form of a dedicated government led mission. This has been a major achievement for us. It allows us to share critical policy level recommendations with the government, with the aim of ensuring that all people in the country have access to basic bank accounts, and social protection.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why do you advocate for financial literacy &amp; inclusion?</strong></h4><p id=\"\">At every stage of life, access to affordable and timely financial resources makes all the difference. For a poor, vulnerable individual, lack of access to affordable financial resources pushes him/her further in the vicious cycle of poverty. The recent COVID crisis has proved the importance of savings, and credit for the ultra poor, and the low and middle income segment. Women across the globe, and more particularly in India, face negative gender norms. The lack of - access to a safe place to save their money or avenues to borrow credit often restricts their empowerment or even worse, traps them in toxic, abusive environments. I hope to be able to bridge these gaps through my work. I believe access to finance, especially to individuals that intent to repay the money, should never be a barrier in their access to a better standard of living, quality education or quality healthcare.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What would you say is the best advice for the next generation of youth (inspiring them to become financially literate)?</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Unfortunately, the world runs on money. There will be a time when you'll need money for a loved one, or to fulfill your own ambitions. Every single penny spent unwisely in the past will come to haunt you at that moment.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. - Theodore Roosevelt (1910)</p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p>", "is_field": true}, {"title": "Battle of the IRAs Calculator", "date": "May 03, 2021", "year": 2021, "location": "Field", "excerpt": "Let's see how much your savings can grow and which IRA wins in the end!Introducing the \u201cBattle of the IRAs\u201d calculator, a sequel to the world\u2019s BEST Roth IRA calculator we introduced last week.", "image": "https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ed75acfc4503863e9b5_624b31834a7725b8af70c899_Untitled%2520design%2520(94).jpeg", "body": "<p id=\"\">Let's see how much your savings can grow and which IRA wins in the end!</p><p id=\"\">Introducing the \u201cBattle of the IRAs\u201d calculator, a sequel to the world\u2019s BEST Roth IRA calculator we introduced last week.

I\u2019ve been doing entrepreneurial-type things since I was like 4, honestly. My first ever journey into it was when my grandpa gave me some seedcorn. My Dad had a garden at the time so I decided to plant them. For whatever reason, my Dad\u2019s own plants died, so I offered mine to him for a price.</p><p id=\"\">After that, I did tons of different stuff as a kid. I started a pawn shop during recess in 3rd or 4th grade, different little mowing and raking companies when I was growing up, and in college, I started an E-Commerce business with my little brother. It didn\u2019t end up gaining traction, but it actually taught me a lot and helped improve my mental models about how to run a successful business. </p><p id=\"\">In my last semester before graduating with a degree in Finance from Akron, a friend of mine told me about real estate investing. I think about things in terms of numbers, so I never quite understood it but he was the one who showed me how the concept really plays out. Once I understood it, I became extremely interested in it. Right before I graduated, I decided to buy a really distressed real estate company. I was able to turn it around relatively smoothly and then I started my career in the corporate path. The same week, I decided to take on another distressed real estate project. The second one was a much harder turnaround. It was very much an extreme emergency of business, as things go. It took a long time to turn around and was extremely challenging to take on while pursuing a corporate career simultaneously. I couldn\u2019t even tell my coworkers what I had going on outside of work. During lunch, I\u2019d lock myself in this little room eating and making real estate calls. I\u2019d be on call at the gym, in bed, basically at all times. I was sweating for a while. Fortunately, we went from exploding, to eventually stable, and then finally we reached the point where we had this thing where we wanted it. We could finally grow and take on new projects.</p><p id=\"\">That\u2019s pretty much where I\u2019m at with that now. I left my corporate job about 8 months ago to go all-in as an entrepreneur We just bought a second self-storage facility in August and hope to buy another one soon. I really like self-storage. People have a lot of stuff and always will. I\u2019m currently very close to buying another small business here in Cleveland that makes and installs glass-box windows.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751edfab106c68fadb1740_624b33e47ce989a7cc2bde07_https%25253A%25252F%25252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%25252Fpublic%25252Fimages%25252Fc6541c8c-cfe2-4a68-a4f1-7d12467e3026_1240x1612.jpeg\" alt=\"\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><h6 id=\"\">Peyton purchasing the glass-box windows business in Cleveland, Ohio.</h6><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: What motivated you to become self-sufficient and leave the corporate path you were on?</strong></p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Peyton</strong>: I think that I had always predetermined that I was going to do it. I have such an extreme personality in the sense of really caring about freedom a lot. Ever since I was young, autonomy has been my highest value. The ability to just be me, be authentic, and live the life that aligns with that and brings the maximum amount of growth to myself.</p><p id=\"\">Originally I had a 10-year plan of working my way up the corporate ladder and then making the jump on my own when I was \u201cready\u201d.

I remember trying to do both and thinking \u201cman, if only I could just focus on one\u201d. Once I made it through though, I realized that I was so glad that I did both.

You have all the skin in the game. When you have a bad day, you won\u2019t just have an unpleasant couple of hours. You\u2019ll have the full consequences reach you, so things will be more emotional. You no longer have a boss, you no longer have mentors unless you\u2019re specifically seeking them out, so you have to understand that the most important thing to manage is yourself.

The mental game-</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Q: Kinda like being a golfer or a tennis player, huh?</strong></p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Peyton</strong>: Exactly.

A major reason for this move was to afford her the opportunity of an education because opportunities for women were limited in Kuwait at that time. Despite taking an accounting class in high school and thoroughly enjoying it, she realized that she was not taught personal finance. While attending UC Santa Barbara, Cooper studied Business Economics with an emphasis in Accounting. She took part in a class that introduced a sliver of consumer economics; living on your own, creating a budget, renting an apartment, buying a car etc. Asides from this class, most of Cooper\u2019s finance knowledge was self-taught. She came across a radio station that discussed personal finance and investing and through simply listening to this station while driving back and forth from school, Cooper educated herself on personal finance. Cooper eventually ended up pursuing a career in Public Accounting and as soon as she got her first job, she invested in a 401k plan and opened up her IRA account at the same time.</p><p id=\"\">When her daughters were growing up, she observed that they were not being taught anything on finance and Cooper says she observed that many of the classes she took on personal finance no longer existed. Cooper believed that this was a necessary class her daughters should be taking and a topic they needed to be educated on. Cooper shared an entry with me from 2013 from her journal, while attending a \u201cback to school night\u201d for her daughters where parents were being informed on specific content and aspects. In her journal Cooper wrote about an \u2018aha\u2019 moment she had on personal finance and wondered why they were not educating young individuals on personal finance from high school. Cooper, realizing that most of her financial knowledge was self-taught and that not only her daughters but her friends, employees and peers did not have the necessary financial knowledge they actually needed and was available, Cooper realized there was a serious need that had to be fulfilled. &nbsp;Cooper had a successful career in Silicon Valley and was able to save and invest with her husband for years. This allowed her the ability to stop working and rekindle her passion for teaching and educating others, specifically on financial literacy. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- \" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"Teaching on Zoom.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ed8a7f8b7359110a431_624b08ef2379f3694dbe133f_Teaching%252Bon%252BZoom.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Throughout her research, Cooper came across <a href=\"https://www.ngpf.org/\" id=\"\">Next Gen Personal Finance</a> and began taking classes with them. She began teaching before the COVID-19 pandemic and like many she did now allow her plan and passion to be derailed and she has continued teaching via Zoom classes. Cooper says that, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a job\u2026 it\u2019s a dream. THE dream job\u201d If there was one thing that Cooper wishes someone told her when she was younger, it is the importance of honing your soft skills; being more open, volunteering, public speaking and simply putting yourself out there. Cooper incorporates these skills from early in her classes so that students are prepared for when their professional careers develop. Asides from public speaking and networking, Cooper believes that one major skill that is necessary in this area is behavioral finance and practicing living within your means. Cooper says, \u201cIt is not just the actual skills of literally here is a spreadsheet and you start filling it out\u2026there is a lot of behavioral finance that goes into it.\u201d There is more to finance than dollars and cents and Cooper wants to help people to understand this. While behavioral finance is a major skill Cooper believes needs to be pushed, she also believes this is the major issue in terms of financial literacy. The notion of not really understanding what it is and not having these foundational skills. </p><p id=\"\">Cooper says that we would never give a 16 year old the keys to a car without the proper driving certifications, so why would we give them the keys to everything as soon as they turn 18, with no training. At the age of 18, one can open a bank account, sign up for credit cards etc. all on their own, yet they frequently lack the education to support these processes properly. She says that COVID has created great awareness and there is now a momentum and everyone simply has to do their share. Cooper is extremely passionate about this issue and providing access to this knowledge to all. As a result, Cooper\u2019s classes are not necessarily non-profit nor are they \u2018for business.\u2019 She does charge for some classes, but believes this helps to build accountability and attendance. Cooper does offer some classes for free and waives fees. She really wants to teach and for it to be affordable. She wants everyone to have that access and believes the earlier they have this access the better.</p><p id=\"\">Carolyn is an incredible advocate (<a href=\"https://finmango.org/carolyn-cooper\" id=\"\">Advocate Profile</a>) and all of us at FinMango would like to thank you for what you are doing.

With all that power and fame, where are all the fishing lessons?</p><p id=\"\">If we know that this epithet is true, and has been true ever since Lao Tzu was supposed to have originally said it, shouldn't we by now have learnt that we all need to be taught how to survive for the rest of our lives? Shouldn't we be making sure that every generation is equipped with the skills it will need?</p><p id=\"\">Back in Lao Tzu's day that was probably actually fishing, but today, right now, and probably for most of the last 100 to 200 years, that should have been finance. Not necessarily \"high finance\" or anything complicated, but enough to understand what money really is, and how to make it work for us more than we have to work for it.</p><p id=\"\">Some time back, an idle thought crossed my mind: I wonder if more people teach fishing than financial literacy, and obviously raced to google to check. Almost everywhere I searched, using different terms, different virtual locations and even different engines, the results showed that people actually do offer and search for fishing lessons more than they do financial literacy.</p><p id=\"\">Yes, more of us are either looking for or offering lessons on fishing, a thing that would have been the latest and greatest thing a couple of thousand years ago, than are looking or offering to help learn how to manage the money in our lives. Which would be the greatest if not latest thing today.</p><p id=\"\">The thing that makes us secure. The thing that might stop us dropping into poverty. The thing that might help us have a happy and healthy retirement. The thing that might, actually, help us \"eat forever\".</p><p id=\"\">I re-ran the test this week on google trends, inspired by Stephen Barnham (who I failed to link here - sorry Steve), and the results are roughly the same - this time run on a global database. On the chart at the top of this post, the blue line is fishing lessons, the red one is finance lessons.</p><p id=\"\">Globally, fishing lessons have been twice as popular on average as financial literacy for the last five years. Lessons for the thing that could actually dramatically change our lives have only been more popular than fishing in only a few weeks out of that period. This is insane.</p><p id=\"\">It's not just fishing. Pottery lessons score 10% more than finance on google trends, and knitting, yes knitting, is only 20% less popular in the last five years!

And they definitely shouldn't be a source of income for people searching them on google!</p><p id=\"\">If I go back to one of the things I said in my last article (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-financial-literacy-could-matter-than-ever-michael-gilmore), that people don't want to be financially literate, they want to be financially stable, secure or even wealthy, then we can see the evidence for this on google too.</p><p id=\"\">\"Financial security\" as a search term is ten times more popular than fishing lessons and 20x times more popular than finance lessons.

It is obviously sad that so many people are concerned about their financial security than so many other subjects, but in some ways it is a positive that they are at least searching for the answer. If we can create and distribute tools, products, books, apps - and maybe even a journal (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-were-trying-use-our-simple-little-journal-solve-two-gilmore) - that address this gap, we can meet this demand head on and help resolve this eminently fixable problem.

As a woman, I assumed that I could hold a very small place in it. This was despite the fact that I was raised by encouraging parents who owned a small scale business, and family dinners often included asking for my opinion about their work.</p><p id=\"\">Being fairly middle class, finance played a significant role in my life. It became even more important when I looked for scholarships to attend a university in the United States and calculated the expenses of studying abroad. My life revolved around finance yet I claimed I would have nothing to do with it. </p><p id=\"\">In college, I quickly changed my major to Economics. I had no particular rationale for doing this apart from the fact that I enjoyed the subject. But finance was a world apart. So, when I came across the FinMango page on my Instagram, I was surprised. I knew immediately that FinMango was doing important work in promoting personal and economic freedom via financial literacy. They were making people independent and self-sufficient- what could be better? This inspired me when I thought the world of finance had little humanity to offer.</p><p id=\"\">Soon after, I took a leap of faith. I messaged the founder and CEO of FinMango, Scott Glasgow, on Instagram asking if his organization had any volunteer opportunities available for a college student with no experience and an interest, that after months of denial, had revealed itself.</p><p id=\"\">FinMango took me on after we messaged<strong id=\"\">. </strong>After two weeks of being a \u201cMango\u201d, I was already in charge of conducting a panel at our grand \u201cEXTRAVAGANZA\u201d event, a 24-hour free Zoom call, where people from all walks of life were united in one mission \u2013 to promote financial literacy. Specifically, I conducted a panel discussion on the importance of financial literacy for women in the world of business. As I prepared for the panel, I felt a bit like an imposter. I used to view finance as a very male-dominated field, but here I was, talking to women pioneers in venture capital, risk management, and corporate law. My belief that finance was a place that I didn't belong was shattered<strong id=\"\">. </strong>I wasn't disappointed to be wrong.</p><p id=\"\">A topic that came up in the panel was the low number of women represented in the financial services industry and the relative invisibility of those who were. We also talked a lot about confidence. This struck me on a very personal level. Despite successfully navigating a very quantitative- heavy major, I didn\u2019t feel confident in my abilities to handle finance or numbers. In this panel<strong id=\"\">, </strong>as well as conversations I have had with my peers, there is agreement that women are socialized into being nice and modest, often at the expense of their confidence. The lack of this quality can infiltrate our careers and the way we view finance. </p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1164px\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1164px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"unnamed.png\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751ed87d30f9187c375b7a_624affc330ba02db13f76bc9_unnamed.png\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Developing this innate confidence also depends on the community one is surrounded by. At FinMango, I have been given opportunities that strengthened my belief in my ability to make a change. One prominent example of this is the Google collaboration, an open source data project designed to collect information about the COVID-19 pandemic. I worked with a team that supported my outlook and encouraged my leadership in a world that often tells women otherwise. Additionally, the internal training opportunities for volunteers have led me to meet some of the most fascinating leaders in fields of marketing and corporate law, who have mentored me and shared their knowledge, skills, and external resources to help me succeed in the business world. To say I am one of the lucky few is an understatement. </p><p id=\"\">Women are underrepresented in the financial services industry, are <a href=\"https://www.annuity.org/financial-literacy/women/#:~:text=Women%20are%20three%20times%20as,lower%20rates%20of%20financial%20literacy.&text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20women%20earn%20less,same%20living%20expenses%20men%20pay\" id=\"\">less likely to be financially literate</a>, yet, according to an article by <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/03/08/womens-wealth-is-rising\" id=\"\">The Economist</a>, women were expected to control $72 trillion of the world\u2019s wealth by 2020, as estimated in 2015. The number of women represented in the financial services industry is growing, as companies promise equal representation. But it shouldn\u2019t stop there \u2013 the goal is to ensure equity through visibility. Women should not just have a seat at the table; their voice and professional opinions should be accorded equal legitimacy as their male peers. Workforces should encourage the confidence of women, rather than subscribing to archaic societal norms of meekness. </p><p id=\"\">The FinMango community, the resources it has provided me with, and my personal experiences convince me that I can help drive change. By building my confidence and providing me with endless opportunities, FinMango has changed the way I view finance, my place in it as a woman, and has shown me what I can do to help those who come after me. It has inspired me to follow my passion of increasing financial literacy among women and making the financial services industry more representative. But equality- true equality- can only exist when it is not limited to pockets and available to a \u201clucky few\u201d but is an indisputable fact of life for all.

At that time, I thought nothing more of it, he was a workout friend who I\u2019d played tennis with since high school. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">As the summer progressed, our conversations while paddling around on the kayaks kept turning towards this idea he had for a nonprofit called FinMango - a foundation that would &nbsp;address the inequitable access to financial literacy throughout the world. Well, I figured, \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d I quickly jumped aboard this opportunity to give back to the community at large by starting something of my own. On a smaller but just as meaningful scale, &nbsp;I had started a STEAM nonprofit in high school that reached hundreds of students. That experience made the idea of helping thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of people a lot more fathomable.</p><p id=\"\">This simple burning desire to create and volunteer led to many sunburnt afternoons spent discussing the concept on Nim. Somehow, these kayaks turned out to be the first boardroom, and the beating sun was our Zoom background before Zoom was even mainstream. Early phone calls made by Scott and I often came while we were on the water. Somehow, we\u2019d have to figure out how to make sense of the ideas that floated across the (nonexistent) waves. Like the sky above us during those times, there truly wasn\u2019t a limit.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1000px\" data-rt-type=\"\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1000px\"><div id=\"\"><img alt=\"IMG-5039-Original.jpg\" src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751edb3857e4eec3f28d9b_624b00d15d2e2fadbc059f53_IMG-5039-Original.jpeg\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Fast forward to September, 2020. We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and consequently, I had spent my first summer home since the one in &nbsp;2016. Scott and I are again kayaking on Nimisila. As we\u2019re paddling into the middle of the reservoir, we wonder why so many people are in the water and what dozens of spectators had anxiously put up lawn chairs to witness. What Scott and I were about to witness is a perfect, but admittingly cheesy, analogy to where FinMango has progressed since its inception 4 years prior. </p><p id=\"\">The purple martins emerged from the horizon. They came in black streaks all while somehow creating a harmonious cacophony. Seemingly endless waves kept gliding past us in disjointed patterns until they would suddenly create a beautifully symmetric vortex. To us, their flight trajectories seemed to make no sense, until it did. Again and again, the smattering of birds across the sky would collect more of their brethren and then orchestrate symphonic tornados. The finale was the last vortex of birds, perfectly choreographed and synchronized. The great fall migration had begun. </p><p id=\"\">Much like the purple martins, FinMango came from a conglomeration of ideas. Waves of fresh inspiration came from journals, conferences, and long conversations. Thousands of hours of work had been put into a variety of different projects by hundreds of volunteers, forming these successful vortexes that validated the original concept. But, we\u2019re now at an inflection point. I know we\u2019re at the same stage as the last vortex of the purple martins, where everything is now coming together. We always had this grandiose vision, but as an organization, we now understand <em id=\"\">how</em> we\u2019re going to fly onto the big stage and <em id=\"\">what</em> we need to get there. Through calculated miracles, we\u2019ve managed to make sense of the beautiful cacophony (by separating our work into 3 pillars: Data, Tech, and Advocacy), and now we\u2019re ready to migrate. </p><p id=\"\">\u200d</p>", "is_field": true}, {"title": "First Principles Thinking", "date": "Feb 25, 2022", "year": 2022, "location": "Field", "excerpt": "Aristotle defined a first principle as, \u201cthe first basis from which a thing is known.", "image": "https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62a95a7e3f26b616be8fde9f/63751edbf4dc55adc3997a07_623fc129f4290dbd43c64609_Untitled%2520design%2520(19).jpeg", "body": "<h5 id=\"\">Aristotle defined a first principle as, \u201cthe first basis from which a thing is known.\u201d</h5><h3 id=\"\">First, a few definitions.</h3><p id=\"\">A \u201cfirst principle\u201d is a foundational assumption or proposition \u2014 it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions or propositions.
